# Discord Bot Project
This bot sends pet images accompanied by short text.
This repository contains two different versions of a Discord bot.  

The first version is written in Python. It is very simple, does not connect to any database.

The second version is written in JavaScript. It is more advanced, dockerized for easier deployment, and connects to Supabase (database and bucket).
